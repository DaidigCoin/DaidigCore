Package: daidigd
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: peer-to-peer network based digital currency - daemon

 payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Daidig uses peer-to-peer
 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Daidig Core
 is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.
 .
 This package provides the daemon, daidigd, and the CLI tool
 daidig-cli to interact with the daemon.

Description: peer-to-peer digital currency - standalone transaction tool
 Daidig is an experimental new digital currency that enables anonymous, instant
 payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Daidig uses peer-to-peer
 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Daidig Core
 is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.

 This package provides daidig-tx, a command-line transaction creation
 tool which can be used without a daidig daemon.  Some means of
 exchanging minimal transaction data with peers is still required.
